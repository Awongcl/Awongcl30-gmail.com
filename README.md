# Solar LiPo Manager
The goal of this project is to develop a PCB that supports LiPo charging by either Solar/USB input with battery protection features integrated. Then output a regulated 3.3V output to power other electronics, mainly low power microcontroller.

## Requirments:
1. 2 Methos of charging : Solar and USB
2. Output must be stable at 3.3V
3. Add in battery protection IC's

## Approach:
